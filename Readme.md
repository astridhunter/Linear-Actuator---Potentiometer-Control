The following code is to drive an Linear Actuator with the help of a linear potentiometer, 
->the potentiometric range results in the movement of the actuator

-> the actuator can move in 2 directions :- 1. Forward
                                            2. Backward

A Set-Up of 2 linear actuator in a single line in opposite directions is considered , a string is tied connecting them

This functionality of driving a linear actuator using a potentiometer is being used here to stretch the string in both directions to calculate the tension(here the potentiometric value) at which the string breaks

this experimental set-up is repeated with strings of different materials
